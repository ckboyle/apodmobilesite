# NASA Astronomy Photo of the Day Mobile Site
This is a simple site built in AngularJS to demonstrate performing API calls by creating a service and displaying them in a view. I also used ZURB's Foundation for Apps system to create the initial structure of the app.
## Credits
Huge thanks to NASA for providing a public API for their awesome Astronomy Photo of the Day feature.
